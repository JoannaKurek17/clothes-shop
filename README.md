# Clothes-shop

Tolando is a simple application for an online clothing shop. It is possible to create a customer account. When creating an account, user data such as name, surname and address must be entered. The user has a choice of clothing categories and pages. After selecting a product and adding it to the shopping cart, the user has to select a form of payment. After this - the user receives an "Zamówienie przyjęte" notification on the screen. The user must be logged in to make a purchase.
It is also possible to search for clothes by name and to preview the selected product to view more details.
The user can also view the purchase history.
